# Cart-Pole-Control-Problem
Matlab code for simulating and controling the inverted pendulum on a cart problem.
An inverted pendulum is a classic problem in control theory and robotics. It involves a
rigid pendulum that is mounted on a cart, where the objective is to keep the pendulum
balanced in the upright position by moving the cart back and forth., see Figure 1. This
problem is challenging because it requires precise control of the cart’s position and velocity
to maintain the pendulum’s equilibrium.
